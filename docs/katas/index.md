# Katas

A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) is a "detailed choreographed pattern of martial arts movements".
For this labs project, we're using "kata" a a term for a pattern of interactions with a STAC service.
Each **kata** represents a common use-case for STAC in the real world.
We execute each **kata** against different backends, and compare the results for performance and cost.

## Configuration

We do our best to encapsulate most of our test configuration in a custom Python package, called `labs_375`.
