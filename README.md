# stac-geoparquet API backend

[![CI](https://github.com/developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

We're building a service to search [stac-geoparquet](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-geoparquet) with a STAC API [query](https://api.stacspec.org/v1.0.0/item-search/).

## Developing

Get [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), then:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend.git
cd labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend
scripts/install
```

To lint:

```shell
scripts/lint
```

## Core assumptions

- Everything we build should either be in this repo or in an already-existing one ... we shouldn't stand up any new repos.
- We're _not_ going to use [stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi) or [stac-fastapi-pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi-pgstac).
  We might end up porting over code or ideas later, but @gadomski wants this to be green-field.
- We want to be public-by-default (with appropriate throttling) with all of our services.
  We want to show this off to the world, not keep it secret.
- We'd like to use [stac-rs](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-rs) (and its Python friends, [stacrs](https://github.com/gadomski/stacrs) and [pgstacrs](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstacrs)) as much as possible.
  This is partially a sop to @gadomski, but we think that the performance and reusability benefits of Rust will be part of what makes this project special.
- APIs should be FastAPI, which is the de-facto standard here at Development Seed for good reason.

## Project management

We love ðŸŒ³.
Almost everything's in a hierarchy:

- [Issue 1](https://github.com/developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend/issues/6) is the tree root
- Under **Issue 1** there are several [phases](https://github.com/orgs/developmentseed/projects/140/views/1), which may run simultaneously
- Phases are composed of [User stories](https://github.com/developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22user%20story%22)
- Finally, tasks are the leaves.
  Tasks might live here, or they might be issues on other repos.

    phase_1 --> story_1
    story_1 --> task_0
    story_1 --> task_1

    issue_1["Issue 1"]
    phase_0["Phase 0"]
    phase_1["Phase 1"]
    story_0["User story 0"]
    story_1["User story 1"]
    task_0["Task 0"]
    task_1["Task 1"]
```

[Milestones](https://github.com/developmentseed/labs-375-stac-geoparquet-backend/milestones) are checkpoints and are used to group phases.
Bugs and one-off tasks can live outside of the hierarchy.
